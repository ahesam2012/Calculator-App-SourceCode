# Calculator-App-SourceCode
Calculator App Source Code (Published on google Play store, link will be in the README file)
This is a calculator App that I have made on my free time :) I have published this app and it can be found at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BOSS.calculator

All the code for the logic will be found in the MainActivity.java file inside the source code folder. This is programmed using android studio and all
the design is also done by me (Buttons, colours, different screen layouts for different phone sizes etc etc).
